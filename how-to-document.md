# How to Write Documentation
Documentation is a lot of things. It may be very techical and closely tied to a specific piece of software, or it may be more general pertaining to concepts etc. This repository (`start-here`) is meant to hold more of the later than the former.

The specific documentation should go with its associated code in a common repository, or alternatively in the wiki provided by GitHub. Have a look at [readme-driven-development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html) for code documentation.

#### Subfolders
For documentation of larger projects, please use subfolders to categorize the content. This way we can navigate the documentation by inspecting the source tree.

#### Blogs
If you have some content that is more of an oppinion on, e.g. how the labs should be tidied up, or how to write great code, you should write your name and date on the post, such that we know that this is a personal oppinion not a universal truth.
