# Set Up the Router
The Turtlebot set includes a small Wi-Fi router. You can use it to connect your laptop to the Turtlebot wirelessly. It is possible to use the university wireless infrastructure, but some port numbers are blocked, coverage may be poor and latencies occur.

One downside of using the router is that you do not have internet through it and it is not allowed to add a wireless router to the university network. However, if you need internet on the Turtlebot, just log on to the university Wi-Fi, get what you need, and log back into your private router.

The included router is a D-Link GO-RT-N300. Below is a getting-started guide:

### 1. Unbox the router
Inside you will find the router, a wall power adaptor and an ethernet cable.

### 2. Hook it up for setup
Plug the wall adaptor into a wall socket and into the router. Connect the ethernet cable to  one of the ethernet ports. Turn the router on.

### 3. Reset the router
Other groups may have used the router befor you, so to avoid any trouble just do a hard reset. You do this by pressing and holding the little reset button on the back for at least 10 seconds.The globe light on the front will blink to confirm that the router was reset.

### 4. Set up the router
Direct your browser to http://192.168.0.1. After the reset the router will ask you to input an SSID. The default will be "D-Link_GO-RT-N300”. Do not use the default, all the other groups also has this type of router, and it will cause confusion. Choose a unique name which also makes sense, e.g. your group number, “B203_turtlebot”. Choose a passkey to avoid any malicious infiltration (by the other groups). You can also choose between DHCP and static IP adresses. Choose DHCP for now. Click save and everything should be working. If you feel like it, you can log into the router with the default login, “Admin” for username and nothing for password to change any parameters.

### 5. Log onto the Wi-Fi
Now use the SSID and passkey you chose above to log onto the Wi-Fi.
