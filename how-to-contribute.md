# How to Contribute
If you have got something to tell, you think that something is missing, or you found somthing that is incorrect you have a couple of options.
First, to contribute you should have a user on GitHub (that is no biggie, you should have a user on GitHub anyways).
Then, you can either open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AalborgUniversity-ControlLabs/start-here/issues).
Alternatively, you can edit the documentation yourself.
This is preferred, but you need editing rights.
Get these by contacting an owner/admin.
Have a look at the [people](https://github.com/orgs/AalborgUniversity-ControlLabs/teams) in the organization.

## Writing Markdown
GitHub automatically renders the Markdown files into nice-looking pages.
You can edit the files online or locally by cloning this repository.

Here is a couple of [guides to Markdown](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) from the folks at GitHub.

## Adding to the Table of Content
Noting is automatic, if you think that your page belongs in the TOC, edit the [Read Me](README.md).
